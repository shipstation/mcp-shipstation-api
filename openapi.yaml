      Batches are an advanced feature designed for those who need to generate
      hundreds or thousands of labels at a time.

      When ShipStation generates labels it relies on many carriers dependencies
      and variables to fulfill your requests, which can take a few minutes.
      Using batches reduces this time significantly for those with high label
      volume.

    summary: Manifests
    description: >
      Many manifests are sent electronically to the carrier when you create a
      label, and

      often physical manifests are not necessary. Carriers receive the package
      details, shipping date,

      and other information that help them plan your package's delivery when you
      create a label.


      However, some providers, like USPS require manifests when shipping large
      numbers of packages. Think about how long it would take for a delivery
      driver to arrive, pick up 100 packages, and individually scan each of
      them.


      A manifest exists so the carrier can scan the manifest and check in all
      the packages being shipped.
